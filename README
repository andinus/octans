3.1 Implementation
──────────────────

  Initially it went over the list of words & checked if they exist in
  the grid. This was very slow.

  Currently it walks the grid & checks if the current string exist in
  the dictionary. This is faster for these reasons:

  • The dictionary is sorted, we perform binary range search on the
    dictionary to return the list of all words that start with specific
    string.
  • Starting positions are limited.

  If the dictionary wasn't sorted then this probably would've been
  slower than previous implementation.


3.2 Options
───────────

3.2.1 dict
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Octans's default dictionary file is `/usr/share/dict/words', use
  `--dict' flag to change the dictionary. The words in dictionary must
  be seperated by a newline (`\n') & sorted alphabetically.


3.2.2 path
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The path to be passed must be a *readable file* or an *url* in either
  format:

  • Link when you view it from your local instance:
    <https://tilde.zone/web/statuses/105531207939242077>

  • Link from Algot's profile:
    <https://mastodon.art/@Algot/105333136907848390>


3.2.3 verbose
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  This will increase verbosity.
